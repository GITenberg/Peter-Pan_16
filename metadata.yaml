description: "Peter Pan; or, the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up or Peter and Wendy is J.\
  \ M. Barrie's most famous work, in the form of a 1904 play and a 1911 novel. Both\
  \ versions tell the story of Peter Pan, a mischievous yet innocent little boy who\
  \ can fly, and has many adventures on the island of Neverland that is inhabited\
  \ by mermaids, fairies, Native Americans and pirates. Peter has many stories involving\
  \ Wendy Darling and her two brothers, his fairy Tinker Bell, the Lost Boys, and\
  \ the pirate Captain Hook. The play and novel were inspired by Barrie's friendship\
  \ with the Llewelyn Davies family. Barrie continued to revise the play for years\
  \ after its debut until publication of the play script in 1928.\nThe play debuted\
  \ in London on 27 December 1904 with Nina Boucicault, daughter of playwright Dion\
  \ Boucicault, in the title role. A Broadway production was mounted in 1905 starring\
  \ Maude Adams. It was later revived with such actresses as Marilyn Miller and Eva\
  \ Le Gallienne. The play has since been adapted as a pantomime, stage musical, a\
  \ television special, and several films, including a 1924 silent film, Disney's\
  \ 1953 animated full-length feature film, and a 2003 live action production. The\
  \ play is now rarely performed in its original form on stage in the United Kingdom,\
  \ whereas pantomime adaptations are frequently staged around Christmas. In the U.S.,\
  \ the original version has also been supplanted in popularity by the 1954 musical\
  \ version, which became popular on television.\nThe novel was first published in\
  \ 1911 by Hodder & Stoughton in the United Kingdom and Charles Scribner's Sons in\
  \ the United States. The original book contains a frontispiece and 11 half-tone\
  \ plates by artist F. D. Bedford (whose illustrations are still under copyright\
  \ in the EU). The novel was first abridged by May Byron in 1915, with Barrie's permission,\
  \ and published under the title Peter Pan and Wendy, the first time this form was\
  \ used. This version was later illustrated by Mabel Lucie Attwell in 1921. In 1929,\
  \ Barrie gave the copyright of the Peter Pan works to Great Ormond Street Hospital,\
  \ a children's hospital in London.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
